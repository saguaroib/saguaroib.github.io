                    Saguaro is a small branch of <a href="http://1chan.net/futallaby/">Futallaby</a> that has been developing slowly but surely thanks in a large part to the people that have helped along the way.<br>
                    If you have problems with your board, then check the support board or contact me on the IRC and I will try to help out.<br>
                    If you have suggestions, there's a board for that.

Anyway&#44; click "Link" to be transported to a magical world of stuff.<br>Something to note as well is that github's now the place to go for a cutting edge copy of saguaro.

The new features of course can all be toggled on and off from the config.php file&#44; so if you don't want to use the javascript features and just want the pager fix&#44; then there you go.<br><br>Be aware that this is a beta&#44; and while is should be stable&#44; don't be surprised if things go wrong.<br><br>And if things do happen to go wrong&#44; please be sure to let us know on /suprt/&#44; and be sure to check /suprt/ and /sug/ for any new posts from RePod concerning the scripts.</blockquote><br clear=left>

Yes&#44; that means those are susceptible to being taken offline or otherwise impeded.<br><br>The link I'm putting up is a link to the whitehouse.gov petition to re-classify ISPs as common carriers and at least temporarily halt any more attempts on net neutrality.<br><br>Please&#44; sign the petition&#44; call/write your local politicians and spread the word about how bad this is and how bad it can really get&#44; and if you're not in the US&#44; you can still help by signing this (<a href="http%3A%2F%2Fact.freepress.net%2Fsign%2Finternet_FCC_court_decision2%2F&amp;b=4" target="_blank">http://act.freepress.net/sign/internet_FCC_court_decision2/</a>)&#44; among other things.<br><br>News Link: <a href="http%3A%2F%2Fgizmodo.com%2Ffederal-court-invalidates-net-neutrality-rules-sides-w-1501028467&amp;b=4" target="_blank">http://gizmodo.com/federal-court-invalidates-net-neutrality-rules-sides-w-1501028467</a></blockquote><br clear=left>
